# Real-Estate-Power-BI-Project

## 1. Problem Statement:

Real estate leadership lacks a comprehensive performance overview, hindering strategic decision-making. Key information gaps include property status, time on market, price trends, property details, and agent performance. Addressing these gaps will enable data-driven enhancements in pricing, marketing, and agent strategies.

## 2. Objective:

The objective of this dashboard is to provide leadership with a thorough understanding of business property status, time on market, price trends, property details, and agent performance. This will facilitate data-driven improvements in pricing, marketing, and agent strategies.

## 3. Key Visuals:

1.	KPI Cards (Top Row): display the overall inventory under management and the status breakdown (sold, pending, for sale) of properties.
	
2.	Doughnut Charts: Each doughnut chart visualises the share of total inventory by status, helping you quickly spot the balance across stages.
	
3.	Combination of bar and line chart: Track the number of properties in each time bucket. Overlay price trends to see if longer time on market correlates with price movements.
   
4.	Slicer (A list of agents on the left): This slicer can be used to examine the performance of each agent and customise other visuals accordingly.
   
5.	Property Table (Bottom-left): A detailed, tabular reference for drilling into individual properties. Useful for verifying data or performing actions on specific listings.
    
6.	Waterfall Chart (Lower Right): Compare how different property types are performing (e.g., Sold vs For Sale vs Pending) to identify which types are moving fastest.

   ## 4. Key Insights:

1.	Out of 3000 properties, 1045 are sold (34.83%), 998 are pending (33.27%), and 957 are for sale (31.90%).
      
2.	Alex Johnson leads in total properties (617) and sold properties (224). John Doe has the most pending (208), while Mike Lee has the most for sale (208).
   
3.  Longer-dwelling properties indicate a backlog.
   
4. Price trends fluctuate, and sales are distributed across property types.

   ## 5. Recommendations:

1.	Prioritise follow-ups on pending listings to expedite closings.
   
2.	Tackle ageing inventory (Days on Market). Explore unique selling points, refresh listing content, and re-target marketing strategies.
	
3.	Establish dynamic pricing rules that adjust according to days on market and competing inventory.
	
4.	Sustain a balanced inventory across condos, townhomes, and single-family homes to mitigate demand shifts.
